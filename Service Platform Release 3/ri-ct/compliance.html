			<h1><a name="compliance">Compliance Program</h1>
				<p>The OSGi compliance program is a lightweight compliance program
				as defined in <a href="/rfcs/rfc0052">RFC 0052</a>. The test suites for the
				compliance program and the test harness are available from this page. OSGi
				members in good standing may use these tools to verify that 
				an OSGi Framework and set of services complies to the specifications.
				<p>Running the test is not difficult. In principal,
				it is running the test script on your own framework. As an example of how
				to set this up, a zipped test environment using the reference implementation
				is zipped up and can be <a href="test-framework.zip">downloaded</a>.
				<h3><a name="ee"/>The Execution Environment</h3>
				<p>It is advised to run both the director as well as the target
				framework on J2SE. For the director, it is a requirement that 
				the Java Crypto Engine (JCE) is available (this is available standard in
				Java 1.4). Most tests are possible to run on smaller execution
				environments but <b>not all</b>. It is therefore
				assumed that the compliance tests are running on a J2SE environment. The following
				are the test cases that <em>must</em> run J2SE because they use classes
				not in the minimum execution environment. All other test cases can run on
				the VMs that fullfil minimum execution requirements. Note that several of the reference 
				implementations also require more than the minimum execution requirements demands).

				<h2>When does it pass?</h2>
				<p>The OSGi specifications define that a vendor passes when the framework
				passes all the framework tests and any optional services. This implies that
				a vendor can be compliant, even if not all R3 services are implemented! The
				pathological case is a vendor that <b>only</b> implements a Framework. However,
				if a service is implemented, it must pass all associated tests.</p>
				<h2>What should be submitted</h2>
				<p>The output of the test is an <b>XML</b> file. This XML should be 
				mailed to the <a href="mailto:cert-submit@osgi.org">certification authority</a>.				
				<h2>How to get started</h2>
				<a name="starting"></a>Two frameworks are needed to run the test suite. The first framework
				is the director framework. This framework should be a stable framework
				running a log service and an HTTP service. This framework is
				not under test so its version is not relevant for the test. It will have to run the
				<a href="bundles/osgi-director.jar">director bundle</a>. The
				release (for example docs/compliance) directory will contain this bundle in its bundles directory.<br>
				Previously, the director and the target frameworks could run together. Due to permissions testing,
				this is no longer possible. The director <b>must</b> run on another framework as the
				target.<br>
				The bundle includes a user interface that is started when the bundle gets
				started. It is possible to run the director without UI using a command line
				interface or scripts. See <a href="/docs/testing/index.html#director">director options</a> for more
				information about this. The director can run in a secure framework
				but it needs many permissions (and so do the test suites).<br>
				Once the director is running, it will listen to packets that announce
				the so called <i>target</i>. The target is implemented in the
				<a href="bundles/osgi-target.jar">target bundle</a>. This
				bundle can also be found in the releases bundle directory. The director,
				when running will also register the target bundle with the
				HttpService under the name http://localhost:8080/test/director/www/osgi-target.jar
				(where you must fill in localhost and 8080 for what is appropriate
				for your environment). Please note that the director and the target
				use a properietary protocol that must be of the same version.<br>
				The target <i>must</i> run on the framework under test. It is quite small, has no UI (except System.out)
				and is fully under control of the director. Care is taken to use only
				a minimal execution environment. Once it is started it will broadcast
				packets on port 2001. The broadcast can be limited to a single network,
				see <a href="#target">target options</a>for more information.</br>
			Once the director discovers one or more targets, it will add
			them to the menu on the UI. The user can then select the target that
			is targeted for a test run. (It is also possible to add targets <a href="#manually">manually</a>.<br>
			Testcases are bundles that register a service object with the
			<i>director</i> Framework under the name org.osgi.test.service.TestCase. A testcase
			bundle contains a BundleActivator object that should register
			the TestCase service. However, when the test case is actually run,
			it must download a bundle in the target. This bundle is usually
			part of the testcase bundle and many testcases have actually
			several bundles embedded. All testbundles of a release are bundled in a single bundle. This
			bundle will install the testcase bundles. For example the <a href='bundles/osgi-test.jar'>testbundle</a>. This bundle is called osgi-test.jar.<br>
			All testcases work according to the same principle. The download a bundle
			to the target and log all information coming from it. This log information
			is compared to a reference log that is also in the testcase bundle. Any
			deviations from the reference log is considered an error.<br>
			The director will pick up these testcases and list them on the UI. The user can then
			select a testcase and start it. Multiple testcases are selected by dragging
			the cursor over multiple testcases. If no testcases are selected and start
			is pressed, all testcases are run.<br>
			Each testcase is downloaded in the target one by one. Between testcases,
			the target removes all bundles that were installed and removes the
			locations of bundles for any permission. (Bundles that have "~keep~"
			in their name are kept, and thus not removed). This makes every test case run on
			its own (This is different from the previous version). Errors during the
			test case are reported to the message window. If everyting works, the
			testcase that is running gets a green icon (indicating it has PASSED) and
			the message window will show PASSED. Errors are reported and handled as good
			as possible.<br>
			A complete test run of one or more testcases or scripts
			will result in a Test Report. Test Reports can be accessed via the httpservice running in the <i>director</i>
			framework. Once a test run is completed, the URL to the result is listed
			in the message window and can be copied with selecting it and pressing CONTROL+C (Copy). All test reports that have been run are listed
			on http://localhost:8080/test/director.<br>
			The test reports are listed in XML form and HTML form. The HTML
			form is much more readable and the XML form can be used for post
			processing of the results. The HTML is processed from the XML
			form with XSLT. The stylesheet is available under http://localhost:8080/test/director/www/testresult.xsl.<br>
			<h2>Sample session</h2>
			The following example is zipped in <a href="test-framework.zip">test-framework.zip</a>
			which is build from the latest sources every hour.</br>
		<a name="sample"></a>The following direction assume you have "java" in your PATH variable. I.e., when you
		type "java", it will execute the java VM.<br>
		Two Frameworks need to be started, first one for the director which does not require
		permissions. The second runs the target and requires permissions. We can run both
		frameworks from the same directory if we modify the target frameworks working
		directory.
		<ol>
			<li>Create a directory and cd into this. This is your "base" directory.</li>
			<li>Create a jar directory and copy the following files into this directory:
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td><a href="bundles/osgi-framework.jar">osgi-framework.jar</a></td>
					<td>The reference impl. framework.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><a href="bundles/osgi-support.jar">osgi-support.jar</a></td>
					<td>A bundle that starts the log service, http service, and has some interfaces. This
						is used by the osgi-director.jar because the osgi-refimpl.jar cannot run on 
						2 frameworks on the same host due to port contention.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><a href="bundles/osgi-refimpl.jar">osgi-refimpl.jar</a></td>

				</tr>
			</table>
			</li>
			<li>Just try to start the framework. This is achieved with:
			<pre>
  java -jar jar/osgi-framework.jar
					</pre>
			This should start, and exit, the framework. The framework exits immediately because
			there is no bundle to run. You should see a message like:
			<pre>
  $ java -jar jar/osgi-framework.jar
  OSGi Framework, specification version 1.1
  This is a reference implementation of the OSGi Framework.
  It is written to be correct and easy to understand and is
  intended only to be used for test and reference purposes.
  Copyright (c) 1999 - 2001 Gatespace AB. All Rights Reserved.
  Framework launched
  $
					</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
			First start the director framework. Create a subdirectory
			called director and "cd" into it. 
			<pre>
java \
	-Dorg.osgi.service.http.port=8081 \
	-Dorg.osgi.service.http.host=localhost \
	-jar ../jar/osgi-framework.jar \
	-init \
	-launch \
	-istart ../jar/osgi-support.jar \
	-istart ../jar/osgi-director.jar \
	-istart ../jar/osgi-test.jar 
</pre>		
			Place the contents of this example in a file (remove the \ and make
			it into one line for windows) (or use the director.bat in in the
			test-framework.zip file). For windows/dos place it in a director.bat and for Unix
			place it in director.sh (dont forget to set the x bit).
			<li>
			Next we should start the target framework. This framework may actually run
			on another machine, the UI will automatically detect targets in the
			neighbourhood. Create a new target directory on the same level as the
			director directory, and "cd" into it.
			</li>
			<li>
			Certain test cases require the security to be setup correctly.
			So the next thing is to create a policy file for the security. The policy file
			is very simple, we just allow the framework AllPermission.
			<pre>
  grant codebase "file:jar/osgi-framework.jar" {
	permission java.security.AllPermission;
  };
</pre>
			Place this content in a file called 'policy'.
			</li>
			<li>
			We must set the options of the Java VM to execute in secure mode
			and to set the options of the director. Options are set with the -D
			command of the java VM. They should come before the -jar. The following
			is a small command file that can be placed in a bat or shell file
			depending on your OS. The \ indicates that the line continues.
			<pre>
 java -Dorg.osgi.test.seewait=true \
	-Djava.security.manager \
	-Djava.security.policy=policy \
	-Dorg.osgi.service.http.port=8080 
	-jar ../jar/osgi-framework.jar \
		-init  \
		-launch \
		-istart ../jar/osgi-refimpl.jar \
		-istart ../jar/osgi-target.jar 
</pre>
			Place the contents of this example in a file (remove the \ and make
			it into one line for windows). For windows/dos place it in a target.bat and for Unix
			place it in target.sh (dont forget to set the x bit).
			</li>
			<li>Run the target and director by executing the shell script.</li>
		</ol>
		All the files are <a href='test-framework.zip'>zipped</a>.
		<h2>The Director UI</h2>
		<a name="director">The UI is written with IFC. This is a different UI than Windows
			or Swing but should be quite straightforward for most computer
			users.
			<h3>Selecting a target</h3>
			Goto the menu on the top of the page. The menu shows all the active
			targets that are available on your network. Select the one needed. The
			UI will remember your choice, even when targets go away or come.<br>
			Sometimes a network contains multiple targets and you are only interested
			in the local target. In that case, there is a checkbox "local only"
			that will help. It will remove all targets from other computers
			than your local computer.
			<a name="manually"></a><h3>Selecting a "challenged" target</h3>
			Some OSGi environments are not capable of broadcasting the
			announcement messages or they are on another network where
			broadcasts messages are not forwarded. There solutions to
			this. First, on the top right site there is a text field. Typing
			the name of the host (or IP number) and hitting enter/return will create a target to that host.
			The other solution is to set the broadcast address of the target
			to a single address of your host computer. This is done by setting
			the system property: "org.osgi.test.broadcast" to the destination
			system (or network).
			<h3>Selecting test cases</h3>
			Select the testcases you want to execute. No selected testcases
			is the same as selecting all. Multiple testcases can be selected
			with selecting the first and then keep the mouse pressed and dragging
			it to include more. Unfortunately, the standard select + shift/control
			does not work.
			<h3>Starting a test run</h3>
			A test run is started with pressing the start key. The key
			will become red to indicate a run is in progress. The UI, however,
			remains active and responds to other presses. You can still scroll
			through the testcases and messages. Pressing the same button again (now
			called stop) will attempt to stop the run. This can cause many
			exceptions on the target because it requires the cooperation of the
			test case itself. It is therefore also not always direct.
			<h3>Debugging a test run</h3>
			There are two support options for debugging a testcase. First option
			is to select the debug checkbox. This will log more information. The
			second option is to select the single step checkbox. Every time the
			test case sends log information, the start/stop button will change
			and the progress halts. This allows you to inspect the target framework
			and look at the bundles state. Time outs might step in if the
			session takes too long. In that case, use the disable timeouts
			checkbox option.
			<h3>How to see the log</h3>
			All information that is logged from the target is compared to a
			reference log. Due to the size of the information it is not useful
			to see it when everything is passing. However, during debugging it
			is useful to see this information. First, it is always displayed
			on the console of the target framework. Second, checking the '
			'See all logs' checkbox will show the result in the message window.
			<h3>Progress</h3>
			Some test cases can take a lot of time to execute. Well written test cases
			should indicate progress (they can do this with the TestRun object
			they receive) by sending the percentage of work done. Alas, not
			all test cases are well written. Therefore, the UI will show the progress
			but also a '.' for each received log entry.
			<h3>Managing the director framework</h3>
			The director framework can be managed when the 'manage' button
			is pressed. A small window opens that shows the state of all bundles
			in the framework (this is the director, <b>not</b> the target!).
			There are buttons to start/stop/update/uninstall and install bundles. This
			can be very useful sometimes. For example, it allows one to install the
			test bundles.
			<h3>Running a script</h3>
			<a href="#script">Scripts</a> are XML files. A
			script can be selected from the UI with the 'script' button. You
			are asked to open a file. A reference to this file is placed in the
			Framework's registry as if it was a normal testcase. This allows scripts
			to be executed as normal testcases.<br>
			Scripts cannot be removed.
			<h3>Saving the messages content</h3>
			The message window can be saved with the 'save text' button, or it can
			be copied to the clipboard. Copying is achieved by selecting the text in the
			message window and typing ^C (Control key + C key at the same time).
			<h3>Seeing the test result</h3>
			After a test run, the message window and the status line
			will show where the results can be found (note: I tried to include
			Swing's JEditorPane but I ran into too many shortcomings and strange
			behaviors). The easiest way to direct your browser is to copy the
			URL (^C) and paste it in the appropriate place of your favorite
			browser.
			<h2>Running a script at startup</h2>
			<a name="background"></a>Director is prepared to run scripts in background without a UI. It
			uses a number of properties to control the test run.

					<h2>The Script language</h2>
					<a name="script"></a>The director implements a simple script language for controlling the
					test cases. The language is an XML DTD. Though it is not a script language
					that will have many afficianados, it makes it very easy to parse. A script
					can look like the following example:
					<pre>
&lt;script name="compliance" version="1.0"&gt;
	&lt;delay duration="10" type="sec"/&gt;
	&lt;istart&gt;

	&lt;/istart&gt;
	&lt;testcase&gt;useradmin.tc2&lt;/testcase&gt;
	&lt;waitfor max="10000" count="1" poll="500"&gt;(&amp;(objectclass=org.osgi.test.TestCase)(name=permissions.tc))&lt;/waitfor&gt;

					<h2>The Command Line</h2>
